## **Spam SMS Detection Project**

### **Introduction**
Spam SMS Detection is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning** project that aims to classify text messages as **spam** (unwanted promotional or fraudulent messages) or **ham** (legitimate messages). With the rise of SMS-based scams and marketing messages, an automated system helps in filtering out such spam messages.

---

### **Objective**
The goal of this project is to **develop a machine learning model** that accurately distinguishes between **spam and non-spam SMS messages**. This involves:
- **Data preprocessing** (text cleaning, tokenization)
- **Feature extraction** (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer)
- **Model training** using classification algorithms
- **Evaluation** of the modelâ€™s performance

---

### **Dataset**
We use the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains:
- **Labeled messages** categorized as either `"spam"` or `"ham"`.
- A mix of **promotional, phishing, and regular text messages**.

### **Workflow**
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Load the dataset from Kaggle.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Convert text to lowercase.  
   - Remove punctuation, numbers, and stopwords.  
   - Tokenization & vectorization (TF-IDF).  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Train classifiers like **NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM**.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assess performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

5. **Deployment (Optional)**  
   - Integrate into a real-world application via **Flask, Django, or FastAPI**.

### **Applications**
- **SMS Spam Filtering**: Used in mobile applications and telecom networks.
- **Email Spam Detection**: Similar techniques apply to emails.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Helps detect phishing messages.

This project enhances **text classification skills** and is widely used in **real-world applications**. ðŸš€
